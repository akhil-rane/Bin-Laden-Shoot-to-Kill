# Bin Laden: Shoot to Kill 
A graphical representation of events that occurred during Osama Bin laden assassination implemented using graphics.h library. Matlab Image Processing Toolbox has been used to create binary text files of object layouts.

## How to Run
Copy the files to your machine and click on CG_Project.exe

**Note: All text files here are object layouts in binary format. I have included CG_Project.cpp source file in case you want to edit some stuff.**
